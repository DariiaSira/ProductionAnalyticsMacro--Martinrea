# Documentation for Production Analytics Macro

## Project Description

This macro is designed for the automatic analysis of production data, eliminating the need for manual data collection, processing, and presentation. It is intended to work with automated systems to evaluate their performance, detect downtime, analyze the state of each detail, and visually present the results using charts and tables.

The goal of the macro is to speed up analysis, minimize errors, and help optimize production processes.

## How It Works

1. **Data Import:** The macro automatically loads data from CSV files containing detail parameters and places them on separate Excel sheets.
2. **Calculation of Time Parameters:** It calculates the time difference between events, allowing the duration of operations and downtimes to be determined.
3. **State Analysis:** Based on predefined rules, the macro determines whether each detail's parameters are within acceptable limits. States are classified as "OK" or "NOK."
4. **Data Visualization:** Charts and tables are created to visually demonstrate:
   * Production time.
   * Duration of short and long downtimes.
   * Distribution of detail states ("OK" and "NOK").
   * Efficiency of the automated system.
5. **Summary Table:** All key indicators are consolidated into a single sheet for convenient analysis, enabling quick evaluation of results over the entire period.

## Why It Is Useful

Using this macro has significantly saved resources and improved production by automating key data analysis processes.

Manual analysis of large volumes of data from CSV files typically takes a lot of time, but the macro reduces this process from hours to minutes by performing loading, processing, and visualization automatically.

It helps promptly identify problems by highlighting incorrect data in red, enabling immediate action to address the causes of deviations.

Calculating key metrics, such as production time, short and long downtimes, provides deep insights into process efficiency, helping minimize time losses.

Data visualization through charts and tables makes analysis results accessible and easy to understand for decision-making, while data consolidation in the summary table simplifies monitoring indicators and comparative analysis over different periods.

These improvements help avoid errors, speed up analysis, and create conditions for optimizing production processes, positively impacting overall system efficiency.
